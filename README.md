### ***This project is part for SwiftBeanCount, please check out the main documentation [here](https://github.com/Nef10/SwiftBeanCount).***

## What

This is a small library to convert downloaded data from Wealthsimple (via [WealthsimpleDownloader](https://github.com/Nef10/WealthsimpleDownloader)) to the Beancount format (via [SwiftBeanCountModel](https://github.com/Nef10/SwiftBeanCountModel)).

## Beancount meta data

The library relies heavily on meta data in your Beancount file to find accounts and commodities. Please add these to your Beancount file:

### Commodities

Simply add the symbol used on Wealthsimple:

```
2011-10-18 commodity ACWV
  wealthsimple-symbol: "ACWV"
```

### Accounts

For account you need to add two meta data entries:
* First is the account type (`wealthsimple-account-type`), you can look up the possible values [here](https://github.com/Nef10/WealthsimpleDownloader/blob/main/Sources/Wealthsimple/Account.swift#L37)
* Second is a key (`wealthsimple-key`):
  * For holdings and cash assset accounts this is the symbol of the stock, ETF or currency
  * For dividend income accounts this is the symbol as well
  * For the assset account you are going to contribute from, use `contribution`
  * For the assset account you are going to deposit from, use `deposit`
  * Use `fee` on an expense account to track the wealthsimple fees
  * Use `non resident withholding tax` on an expense account for the tax
  * In case some transaction does not balance, we will look for an expense account with `rounding`
  * In case you get a refund, add `refund` to an income account
  * If you want to track contribution room, use `contribution-room` on an asset and expense account (optional)

## How

Please check out the complete documentation [here](https://nef10.github.io/SwiftBeanCountWealthsimpleMapper/). You can also have a look at the [SwiftBeanCountDownloaderApp](https://github.com/Nef10/SwiftBeanCountDownloaderApp) which uses this library.

## Usage

The library supports the Swift Package Manger, so simply add a dependency in your `Package.swift`:

```
.package(url: "https://github.com/Nef10/SwiftBeanCountWealthsimpleMapper.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0")),
```

## Limitations

Please note that I developed this library for my own needs and there may be bugs. It currently has some limitations:

* Sell Gains are not calculated
* If transactions do not balance, it will add a rounding posting. However, due to SwiftBeanCountModel not yet fully supporting Beancount rounding, the amount of this posting will likely be 0 and need to be adjusted manually.

Pull requests to extend the scope or remove limitations are very welcome.
